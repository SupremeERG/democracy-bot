# Purpose

This application is meant to be a learning tool, teaching me how to pragmatically and securely program decentralized applications (dapps) with Javascript and Solidity. Building and utilizing an application like this teaches one how data is programmatically stored on the blockchain and how the EVM communicates with smart contracts. I also hope to audit the smart contract for vulnerabilities as I am more interested in smart contract security than the development. This project is not much of a practical tool for discord users but rather a challenge for an ethical hacker with developer skills (me).

# Capabilites

* Server mod/administration can start elections for roles (preferably moderation/administration roles) with an arbitrary election duration
* Users can join the election as a candidate
* Users may vote for a candidate one time
* Elections automatically end after the set duration
* All data is stored on the specified Ethereum blockchain

# Disclaimer

* This bot is no where near complete
* I know this application would never be practical because any one hosting the bot would be losing ether due to gas fees
* This application is simply a project where I could learn Solidity syntax; pragmatic, secure, and gas-efficient smart contract programming; as well as EVM concepts.
